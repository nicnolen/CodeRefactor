# CodeRefactor

## Description
I decided to build this project because I have always had a passion to teach users how to run a successful business. 
The most straightforward way to build a successful business is by having proper marketing techniques, which is why I decided to base my project around this topic.
My project describes the three most important factors to maximize the number of users visiting your website: Search Engine Optimization, reputation, and social media.
While building this project, the most important thing I learned is to maximize accessibility for everyone. This means using more semantic (descriptive) elements, adding alternative text to images, and putting headers in sequential order to name a few.
