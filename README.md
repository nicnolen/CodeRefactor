# CodeRefactor

## Description
This project teaches users how to run a successful business. The most straightforward way to make a business successful is by having proper marketing techniques.
This project describes the three most important factors to maximize the number of users visiting your website: Search Engine Optimization, reputation, and social media.
While building this project, the most important thing I learned is to maximize accessibility for everyone. This means using more semantic (descriptive) elements, adding alternative text to images, and putting headers in sequential order to name a few.
